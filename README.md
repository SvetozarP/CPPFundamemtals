# C++ Fundamentals - SoftUni Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems from the **C++ Fundamentals** course at SoftUni.

## 📚 Course Information

This repository is organized by course modules and topics, with each problem solution contained in its own directory.

## 📁 Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

│   ├── 06greatestCommonDivisor/
│   ├── 07printAndSum/
│   └── 08strongNumber/
└── README.md
```

Each module folder contains:
- Individual solution folders named with the problem number and title
- Each solution includes:
  - `*.cpp` - The source code file
  - `*.vcxproj` - Visual Studio project file
  - Other Visual Studio configuration files

## 🛠️ Development Environment

These solutions are developed using:
- **C++** programming language
- **Visual Studio** (based on project file structure)
- **Windows** development environment

## 📝 Modules

### 01. Basic Syntax
Solutions covering fundamental C++ syntax including:
- Variables and data types
- Input/output operations
- Conditional statements
- Loops
- Basic algorithms

**Solutions:**
1. Student Information
2. Passed or Failed
3. Month Printer
4. Foreign Languages
5. Divisible by 3
6. Sum of Odd Numbers
7. Multiplication Table
8. Even Number

### 02. Basic Syntax Exercises
Extended practice problems covering:
- Advanced conditional logic
- Mathematical operations
- Number manipulation
- Algorithm implementation

**Solutions:**
1. Order Two Numbers
2. Product Sign
3. Quadratic Equation
4. Numbers 1 to N
5. Min and Max
6. Greatest Common Divisor
7. Print and Sum
8. Strong Number

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Navigate to the specific problem folder you're interested in
2. Open the `.sln` file in Visual Studio, or
3. Compile the `.cpp` file directly using your preferred C++ compiler

### Compiling from Command Line

If you prefer using the command line, you can compile individual solutions:

```bash
# Example compilation (adjust compiler path as needed)
g++ filename.cpp -o filename.exe
```

Or using MSVC (if available in your PATH):

```powershell
cl filename.cpp
```

## 📖 Notes

- These are my personal solutions to the course problems
- Solutions may not be the most optimal approach
- Feel free to use these as reference, but I encourage you to solve problems on your own first
- Some solutions may include comments explaining the approach or logic
